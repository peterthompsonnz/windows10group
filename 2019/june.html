		<h2>Exploring the Irfanview image viewer and editor</h2>
		<p>
			The Irfanview image image viewer and editor is free and works very fast. Many image formats can be viewed
			and processed. Basic image editing, such as cropping, resizing and sharpening, can be done, along with batch
			processing (crop, resize, and enhance). Thumbnails and contact sheets can be created. Irfanview also has a
			powerful printing feature that allows output print size to be set along with printing resolution.
			Plugins can be installed that greatly extend Irfanview's functionality. For example, video and audio can be
			played back.
		</p>
		<p>
			A common use of Irfanview is to batch resize images that have been taken from a phone or camera. These often
			are very large in size (both in dimensions and file size) and are too large to email easily.
